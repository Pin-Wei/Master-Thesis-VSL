# Master-fMRI-Project
These scripts analyze a dataset from an fMRI experiment, where participants performed a visual statistical learning task. 
We aimed to observe changes in representation similarity before and after learning (via representation similarity analysis), as well as changes in activity during learning (using univariate analysis and generalized physical psychological interaction analysis).
We focused mainly on the visual cortices (including V1+V2, remaining parts of the lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, and inferior temporal gyrus), medial temporal lobe (including parahippocampal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex), and hippocampus (including CA1, CA2+3, CA4+DG).
