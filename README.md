# Master-fMRI-Project

These scripts were developed during my masterâ€™s research, analyzing fMRI data collected from an experiment where participants performed a visual statistical learning task. 
Please note that the underlying database is not currently publicly available.

The analyses performed include, but are not limited to, voxel-wise, ROI-based, MVPA, and functional connectivity approaches. Our objectives were to assess changes in representation similarity before and after learning (via representation similarity analysis), as well as changes in activity during learning (using univariate analysis and generalized physical psychological interaction analysis).

We focused mainly on the visual cortices (including V1+V2, the remainder of the lateral occipital cortex, the fusiform gyrus, and the inferior temporal gyrus), medial temporal lobe (including the parahippocampal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex), and the hippocampus (can be separated into subregion CA1, CA2+3, and CA4+DG).
